### Hi ThereðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
1. I have been working on this project for some time now.

2. You can find the files for basic Crop-Recommendation using Machine learning

3. I have used CFNN algorithm for this

4. I have also given the training data and feed to predict the output.

5. You can run this using MatLab.

6. Just instal MatLab on your pc and open the "main" file and run.

7. The Result would be displayed on your PC after some iteration.

8. Good day to you ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜€
